# WiFi Cert Middleware for ModusToolbox SDK

## Overview

The WiFi Cert middleware provides an easy way to test WFA cert such as 802.11n-PSK, WPA2 Enterprise security, PMF, WPA3 and 802.11AC using ModusToolbox SDK.

The WiFi Cert middleware consists of the following components:

- Sigma Control API specification (CAPI) commands and command handler functions to process commands to and from a test agent.

- WiFi Cert middleware Porting Layer to interface  with Wi-Fi and network layer functionality across SDKs such as FreeRTOS.

## Features

This library provides the library functions used by the WiFi Cert Tester tool to execute WFA Certification test suites for 802.11n PSK, Enterprise security, PMF, WPA3, and 802.11AC.
